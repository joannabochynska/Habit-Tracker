          <p>
            Habit Loop from "The Power of Habit" bu Charles Duhigg is a process
    of forming a habit. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain
    to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is a routine
    which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward
    which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth
    remembering for the future.

            Power of Writing Down
          </h4>
          <p>
            Journaling daily is a powerful tool which helps you evaluate your experiences
    and increase self-awareness. Habit Tracker is based on the idea of Buller Journal
    by Ridel Carroll. It is descripted as a mindfullness practice disguised
    as productivity system.

            Calm the Chaos by Setting Priorities
          </h4>
          <p>
            When we don't set priorities, we tend to follow the path of least resistance.
  Choose 3 most important habits and focus on them to get the results. We believe
  that saying "no" to some things determines what you can actually do.
