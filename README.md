#Habit Tracker

Habit Tracker helps you learn the most effective process, increase self-awareness and set priorities so achieving your goals is easier than ever. It is a tool that enables you to build good habits by tracking them. Concept of building habits is based on Charles Duhigg's book - "Power of habit". The idea of habit tracker was inspired by Bullet Journal created by Ridel Carroll.
